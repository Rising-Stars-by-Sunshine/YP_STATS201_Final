XGBoost offers significant potential in identifying students at risk of dropping out by analyzing complex interactions among various predictors such as demographic characteristics, financial circumstances, and socio-economic backgrounds. The removal of academic performance significantly increased the difficulty of model training. Despite the moderate test accuracy illustrated in the presented model results, the performance is acceptable, considering the challenging nature of social behavior prediction. The ability of XGBoost to handle a variety of data types, its robustness to outliers, and its capacity to capture nonlinear relationships make it particularly apt for educational data, which often involves heterogeneous features and imbalanced classes. Moreover, the model's test accuracy of approximately 78.79% is promising given the context and complexity of educational data, signaling that with further fine-tuning and by addressing issues like overfitting, the model could become an even more reliable tool. Leveraging the XGBoost algorithm can enable educational institutions to proactively deploy interventions and support mechanisms tailored to individual student profiles, thereby mitigating dropout rates and fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
