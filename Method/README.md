# Method

## Description:
The following content is the **METHOD** part of the project. It contains the Prediction Problem and the Machine Learning Workflow.

## 1.1 The Prediction Problem

### Research Question Formulation:

**Objective:** The specific research question aims to identify predictive factors associated with student dropout or successful degree completion, particularly focusing on non-academic factors such as socioeconomic background and student demographics.

**Significance:** This question is crucial in the field of higher education as understanding the multifaceted determinants of student outcomes can inform targeted interventions and support services, ultimately enhancing retention rates and improving educational equity.

### Operational Measures:

**Dependent Variable (Y):** Student academic success (Graduate/Dropout) (rate)

**Independent Variable (X):** Demographic Variables (e.g., age, gender), Financial Circumstances (e.g., debt), Student Background (e.g., Parent's qualification), Social-Economic Factors (e.g., Area GDP)

**Datatype:** Cross-sectional

### Hypothesis Development:

**Prediction Hypothesis:** It is hypothesized that students with lower levels of socio-economic status, weaker financial circumstances, and less advantageous student backgrounds are more predisposed to dropout from higher education institutions.

**Justification:** This hypothesis is grounded in established literature indicating that socio-economic factors, financial constraints, and student background significantly impact educational attainment and persistence. Individuals from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds often face greater barriers to academic success, including limited access to resources, inadequate support systems, and heightened financial strain. Moreover, research suggests that students with parents possessing lower qualifications may lack familial role models and support networks conducive to academic achievement, further exacerbating their risk of dropout. By addressing these underlying social determinants of education, institutions can better tailor interventions and support services to mitigate dropout rates and promote equitable educational outcomes.

**Machine Learning Algorithm Selection:** XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is the optimal choice for analyzing student dropout risk in higher education due to its robust capabilities and versatility. Its scalability, flexibility, and regularization techniques enable accurate predictions by capturing complex relationships within large datasets efficiently. With its ability to handle diverse data types and provide feature importance analysis, XGBoost offers insights into the factors driving student dropout. Its proven high performance in predictive modeling tasks, combined with interpretability, makes it ideal for informing targeted interventions to improve student retention rates. Therefore, the selection of XGBoost is grounded in its ability to address the complexities of predicting student dropout effectively.
