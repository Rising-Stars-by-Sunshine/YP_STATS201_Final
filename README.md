- **Project Summary**: 
  - **Background/Motivation**
    Student dropout and degree completion are critical concerns in higher education, as they significantly impact both individual success and the broader socioeconomic landscape. Despite the extensive research on student retention, a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between various predictive factors is yet to be fully realized. The majority focus on student academic performance when predicting student academic success/failure. However, academic success is often influenced by a myriad of factors extending beyond traditional classroom performance. While academic aptitude undoubtedly plays a vital role, the interplay of socioeconomic background, demographic characteristics are also crucial factors.

### **Self Introduction**
Hello, I am Yian Pei, a passionate and dedicated individual currently pursuing a dual degree program at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and Duke University, set to graduate in July 2025. My academic journey has been complemented by valuable research experiences and a commitment to personal and professional growth.

### **Professional Growth**

Professionally, my journey has been enriched by valuable experiences, from a research stint at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics to an Algorithm Engineer Internship at Ainstec. These experiences, coupled with my role as a Student Research Intern in Bioinformatics, have equipped me with a versatile skill set crucial for navigating the complex intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence. The course has been instrumental in shaping my ability to integrate skills effectively, creating a robust professional profile poised for meaningful contributions.

### **Living a Purposeful Life**

Envisioning the future, I aspire to be a pioneer in the field, contributing to advancements recognized globally. Winning the Nobel Prize or Turing Award is not just a personal dream; it's a testament to the impact I hope to make.

My purpose is to be the founding figure of transformative advancements, leaving a legacy that positively influences the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare.
