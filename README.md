### **Self Introduction**
Hello, I am Yian Pei, a passionate and dedicated individual currently pursuing a dual degree program at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and Duke University, set to graduate in July 2025. My academic journey has been complemented by valuable research experiences and a commitment to personal and professional growth.

### **Intellectual Growth**

<s>Throughout this course, I've experienced substantial intellectual growth, particularly in understanding the profound impact of applying machine learning to address global issues like cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). My exploration into Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and its role in enhancing heart failure prediction has illuminated the significance of transparency in the clinical application of predictive models. The magic of interdisciplinary research lies in its ability to weave together diverse perspectives, paving the way for innovative solutions that can truly make a difference in people's lives.</s>

### **Professional Growth**

Professionally, my journey has been enriched by valuable experiences, from a research stint at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics to an Algorithm Engineer Internship at Ainstec. These experiences, coupled with my role as a Student Research Intern in Bioinformatics, have equipped me with a versatile skill set crucial for navigating the complex intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence. The course has been instrumental in shaping my ability to integrate skills effectively, creating a robust professional profile poised for meaningful contributions.

### **Living a Purposeful Life**

Envisioning the future, I aspire to be a pioneer in the field, contributing to advancements recognized globally. Winning the Nobel Prize or Turing Award is not just a personal dream; it's a testament to the impact I hope to make. <s>My feature sentence reflects a commitment to interdisciplinary research: "Yian Pei, a catalyst for change in healthcare and technology, revolutionized the application of machine learning to predict and prevent cardiovascular diseases, advancing human civilization."</s>


My purpose is to be the founding figure of transformative advancements, leaving a legacy that positively influences the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare.
