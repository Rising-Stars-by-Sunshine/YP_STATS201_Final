Introduction of Literature with Specific Articles for This Research

Academic Predictors in Student Retention:

V. Tinto's Model of Student Departure (1975) serves as a baseline for understanding the relationship between academic and social integration, and its significance in predicting student retention.

Non-Academic Predictors and Their Increasing Importance:

The review by Rumberger and Lim (2008) provides insights into the diverse factors affecting student attrition and the importance of academic performance.
Machine Learning's Role in Education:

The work of Baker and Inventado (2014) outlines the foundations of using educational data mining, and its implications for applying machine learning techniques to student retention.

Utilizing XGBoost in Educational Outcomes:

Shahiri et al. (2015) explore several machine learning algorithms for predicting student performance, mentioning the efficacy of XGBoost in such applications.

This Research Advancements

Combines Multi-dimensional Non-Academic Factors:
This research extends the foundations laid out by Rumberger and Lim by incorporating a broader spectrum of non-academic factors such as financial, cultural, and demographic data, thus presenting a more comprehensive model for predicting student success.

Enhances the Use of XGBoost in Education:
Building upon the work of Shahiri et al., this research delves into the use of XGBoost for analyzing both academic and non-academic factors, enhancing the capability to generate precise predictive models.

Enables Customized Intervention Strategies:
Drawing from the socio-economic models of Baker and Inventado, this research employs a deep analysis of socio-demographic profiles, enabling the creation of targeted intervention strategies.
