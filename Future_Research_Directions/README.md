# Leveraging Causal Inference to Predict and Mitigate Student Dropout Rates: A Machine Learning Approach

## Background/Motivation:
Student dropout is a pervasive problem across educational institutions, leading to individual economic disadvantages and wider societal inequities (Rumberger, 2011). Understanding and predicting which students are at risk of dropping out can enable timely interventions, but traditional predictive models often fail to capture the causal relationships and may be biased by confounding variables. Furthermore, research in this realm has often focused on correlation rather than causation, which does not effectively inform interventions (Bowers, 2010). Addressing this gap, our research is motivated by the need to delineate the causal pathways that lead to student dropout and academic success.

## Research Questions:

- What are the causal relationships between student demographics, academic behaviors, institutional factors, and dropout risk?
- Can a machine learning model that accounts for causal inference improve the accuracy and efficacy of predictions about student dropout and academic success?
- How can the inclusion of causal inference in modeling inform effective and targeted interventions for at-risk students?

## Methods:
To address the complex interdependencies and causal relationships between observed variables, our research will employ a structured causal model (SCM) approach, using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to identify and visually represent the treatment, target, and confounding variables (Pearl, 2009). The treatment variable (T) in this study will be specific academic interventions (e.g., tutoring services, financial aid), the target variable (Y) is student dropout/success, and the confounding variables (C) include student demographics, prior academic performance, and psychosocial factors.

Our machine learning model of choice is Counterfactual Regression, specifically the Causal Forest algorithm (Wager & Athey, 2018), which is adept at handling large datasets with many covariates, allows for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects, and is robust in the presence of complex confounder-treatment interactions. We will employ the grf package in R for its implementation (Tibshirani et al., 2019).

To estimate the causal effects, we will firstly utilize propensity score matching to balance the treatment and control groups regarding the confounding variables, then apply Causal Forest to estimate the potential outcome mean for each individual subject to treatment (Imbens & Rubin, 2015).

## Potential Results:
We anticipate that the Causal Forest model will identify non-linear relationships and complex interactions, resulting in accurate estimates of individualized treatment effects. By understanding these causal pathways, we expect to uncover which interventions are most beneficial for which students, facilitating more personalized and effective dropout prevention strategies.

## Contributions:
This research is poised to make significant contributions to educational scholarship and practice in several ways. Firstly, it advances the methodological frontier by applying causal inference within the context of machine learning to the pressing issue of student dropout. Secondly, it provides empirical evidence supporting the utility of SCM and Causal Forest in understanding and addressing complex educational phenomena. Finally, this approach can offer actionable insights for educators and policymakers by specifying which interventions are most likely to be effective for particular student subgroups.

# Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success: Optimizing Intervention Strategies through Reinforcement Learning

## Background/Motivation:
The high rate of student dropouts in higher education remains a pervasive challenge affecting institutions worldwide (Tinto, 1993; Bean, 1980). Recent research has demonstrated the potential of machine learning in predicting student success and identifying at-risk students through classification algorithms (Bowers, 2010). However, there is a need to move beyond prediction and toward the optimization of intervention strategies that can dynamically adapt to studentsâ€™ evolving educational paths. Reinforcement learning (RL), an area of machine learning concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward (Sutton & Barto, 2018), offers an innovative framework to not only predict dropout and academic success but also to optimize the responses that educational institutions should take in real-time to enhance student retention and performance.

## Research Questions:

- How can reinforcement learning be applied to optimize academic intervention strategies for at-risk students?
- Which state and action variables contribute most significantly to the performance of RL in predicting and mitigating student dropout?
- 
## Methods:
Our study proposes to apply a reinforcement learning algorithm to an educational environment where the agent represents the institutional intervention system. The specific method is an adaptation of the Q-learning algorithm (Watkins, 1989), a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, which we will tailor to the educational context using Python's RLlib, a scalable reinforcement learning library (Liang et al., 2017).

The objective function in this RL framework will be designed to maximize the expected cumulative reward, which in this context will be a composite of academic performance indicators such as grade point average (GPA), course completion rate, and retention status. The states will encapsulate individual student academic records, including demographic information, prior academic performance metrics, engagement metrics, and historical intervention outcomes. Actions will represent potential intervention strategies ranging from personalized counseling to targeted tutoring or financial assistance. The reward variables will be incremental improvements in student performance or retention, quantified based on historical intervention success rates.

## Potential Results:
We anticipate that the optimized RL intervention system will outperform traditional alert-based systems. Improved effectiveness is expected in identifying at-risk students earlier and recommending more personalized, proactive interventions.

## Contributions:
The anticipated contributions of this research are two-fold: (1) it will offer a novel application of reinforcement learning to the educational domain, extending current predictive models into the realm of active intervention; and (2) it will provide practical insights into which interventions are most effective for student success on an individualized basis, thereby supporting more efficient allocation of institutional resources.
